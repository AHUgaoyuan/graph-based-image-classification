This is a TensorFlow implementation of the [Graph-based Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification](https://github.com/rusty1s/deep-learning/tree/master/thesis).

## Requirements

Project is tested on Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.
TensorFlow needs to be installed before running the script.
TensorFlow 0.11.0 and the current `master` version are supported.

To install the required python packages (except TensorFlow), run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running tests

Install the test requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
./ci/test.sh
```
