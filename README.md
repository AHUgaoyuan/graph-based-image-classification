This is a TensorFlow implementation based on my "[Graph-based Image Classification](https://github.com/rusty1s/deep-learning/tree/master/thesis)" master thesis.

## Requirements

Project is tested on Python 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html#pip-installation), [nauty](http://pallini.di.uniroma1.it/) and its python wrapper [pynauty](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~peter/software/pynauty/html/install.html) need to be installed before running the script.

To install the additional required python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have Conda installed or want to install it, you can simply run
```bash
./ci/conda.sh -n graph
```
to install all dependencies in a new conda environment with name `"graph"`.

**Tested Versions:**
* TensorFlow: 0.11.0
* nauty: 26r7
* pynauty: 0.6.0

## Running tests

Install the test requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
./ci/test.sh
```
