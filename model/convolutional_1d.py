# structure of the 1d convolutional neural net. It is build upon five keys:
# 'in_width', 'in_channels', conv', 'full', 'out'.

#
# {
#   'in_width',
#   'in_channels',
#   'conv': [
#     {patch, stride, out_channels, max_pool},

#
# * x - the input: [None, 1, in_width, in_channels].
# * y - the output: [None, out_channels].
# * keep_prob: The probability that a neuron's output is kept during dropout.
#   This allows us to turn dropout on during training, and turn if off during
#   testing.
