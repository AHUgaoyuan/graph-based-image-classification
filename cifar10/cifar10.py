# The archive contains the files `data_batch_1`, `data_batch_2`, ...,
# `data_batch_5`, as well as `test_batch`. Each of these files is a Python
# "pickled" object produced with `cPickle`.
#
# Each of the batch files contains a dictionary with the following elements:
# 1. **data** -- a 10.000x3072 `numpy` array of `uint8`s. Each row of the array
#    i stores a 32x32 colour image. The first 1024 entries contain the red
#    channel values, the next 1024 the green, and the final 1024 the blue. The
#    image is stored in row-major order, so that the first 32 entries of the
#    array are the red channel values of the first row of the image.
# 2. **labels** -- a list of 10.000 numbers in the range of 0-9. The number at
#    index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array `data`.

# Python dictionary object. It has the following entries:
# 1. **label_names** -- a 10-element list which gives meaningful names to the
#    numeric labels in the `labels` array desribed above. For example,
#    `label_names[0] == 'airplane'`, etc.
